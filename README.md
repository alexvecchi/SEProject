# SEProject - John Wick
Repository of "Sistemi Embedded" Project

This is the main page of the project of Boris Coteata and Alex Vecchi, approved by Professor Andrea Trentini some time ago (08/11/2018) but for work reasons we will able to complete it only in this year.
Our project is to build piece by piece a little car/tank that can be driven by a remote controller (built by us too) and that can try an automatic guide recognizing the obstacles that could occurs on its way. The name of this project came from the character of the movie series "John Wick", we decided to call the car in this way onli becaus the chassis is built from an "Air Wick air freshener" :)
